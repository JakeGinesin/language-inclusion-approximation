# Language Inclusion Approximation
For some automata that accept regular languages, $A,B$, checking whether $L(A) \subseteq L(B)$ is a PSPACE-complete problem. This problem can be underapproximated with integer linear programming, a NP-complete problem. This repository is an implementation of this approximation approach.
